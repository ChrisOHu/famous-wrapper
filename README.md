useraccounts:famous-wrapper
===========================

A very smart [Famo.us](http://famo.us) wrapper which uses [famous-views](https://atmospherejs.com/gadicohen/famous-views) to wrap up any version of AccountsTemplates to give you animated sign up and sign in templates straight away!

You can lear how to use it reading [Wrapping Up for Famo.us](https://github.com/useraccounts/core#wrapping-up-for-famo.us) chapter inside the official [documentation](https://github.com/useraccounts/core) for AccountsTemplates.

Lets have a look at a [live demo application](http://accounts-templates-famous-wrapper.meteor.com)!


## Bring Your Own Famo.us

Adding this package with `mrt add useraccounts:famous-wrapper` does not add any other packages providing Famo.us. This is to let you choose your preferred way to include Famo.us!
